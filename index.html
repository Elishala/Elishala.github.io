          <p>Durham:
          Studying Front-End Engineering at The Iron Yard was an awesome experience.
          For 12 intense weeks I spent 70-80 hours a week studying HTML5, CSS3, &amp; JavaScript.
          The process of web development fascinates me in an entirely new way.
          It intrigues me that so much depends on zeros &amp; ones, that we've built a culture of technology
          that has shifted the way we communicate, &amp; that to write code,
          one must learn how a computer processes information. I am excited about how much
          there is to learn, while striving to strike a balance between using logic with creativity in my career.
          It's an incredible process to build something that joins people all over the world.

          <p>Durham:
          Before The Iron Yard, I was studying design &amp; hand lettering, working as a store artist.
          Of all the responsibilities I had in that position, what I enjoyed the most was hand lettering
          on chalkboards, as well as preparing store signage in Illustrator. I tend to gravitate towards a minimalist design,
          while conscientiously considering fonts, shapes, &amp; colors.

          <p>San Fransisco, Carrboro:
          I remember sitting in class one day with a decisive feeling about needing to learn how to draw.
          I went on to sell my illustrations at weekly farmer's markets, festivals in Northern California, &amp; at The ArtsCenter
          in Carrboro, NC. Taking an idea, spending hours drawing lines &amp; adding colors in order to tell a story
          brings out my playful nature. Drawing was what led me to study design; design was what led me to web development.
          </p></div>
          <div class="flex-item-4">
          <p>Columbus, Houston, Denver/Boulder, San Fransisco:
          Prior to drawing, my background was in holistic health where I worked as a Massage Therapist, studied yoga &amp; meditation.
          During this time I asked an abundance of questions about how muscles relate to bones, how breath relates to relaxation
          as well as strength, &amp; how the mind can be tamed with sincere practice. What I enjoyed most about this work was observing
          how people transform.
