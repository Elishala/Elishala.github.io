//take domain name & add it to github

what do i want my portfolio to say about me?
who am i? what value can i bring to them?

my name needs to be clear & prominent
front end designer/developer (ask about this) -should be fine, 
clearest & shortest way.
write words down first, the ones that will go on the screen.
when they land on the page, could make a large button that says 'hire me', then a background pic... for
exp.
could have links for portfolio, contact ... want multiple places for them to take primary actions.
nav bar? footer? that sorta thing.
what do i want them to realize about me. want this clear & action i want them to take clear.
